    "contents" : "# adventureR\n\nThis package contains all of the functions written for posts on the [Big Blog of R Adventures](http://michaelquinn32.github.io/). Obviously, since it accompanies a blog, the package will always be \"in development\". Nonetheless, this should make it a lot easier to organize, document and share the code produced for this project.\n\n## Posts\n\n### Old School Classification Methods\n\nA very simple suite of functions and methods to accompany a post on classification. During the post, I fit and create predictions with Naive Bayes and Linear Discriminant Analysis.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis package is intended for very limited use, since most of the functions a drafted to illustrate something in a blog post. But if you would like to experiment with its few functions, feel free to install it.\n\n```R\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"michaelquinn32/adventureR\")\n```\n",
