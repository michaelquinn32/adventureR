#' @details
#' This package accompanies the \href{http://michaelquinn32.github.io/}{Big Blog of R Adventures}.
#' Since its only unifying theme is the blog, its primary function is to gather, document and share
#' the code developed in support of that blog. For that reason, the package should always be considered
#' "in development."
#'
#' The code here will also be on the raw side. Instead of running perfectly under most use cases,
#' I am much more interested in producing code that can be easily interpreted. Again, we're
#' illustrating how R can solve lots of problems, not how to write the world's most perfect
#' R code (even if there is such a thing).
